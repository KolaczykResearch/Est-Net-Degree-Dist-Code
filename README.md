# Est-Net-Degree-Dist-Code
This repository contains Matlab code and supporting files corresponding to the methodology for estimation of network degree distributions under random sampling described in the article:
Zhang, Y., Kolaczyk, E.D., and Spencer, B.D. (2015).  Estimating network degree distributions under sampling: An inverse problem.  Annals of Applied Statistics, 9(1), 166-199.

Primary code implementing the algorithm is in the folder MCSURE_fns_QP_smooth1.
The main function is EstimatingDegreeDistribution.m
The files run_d.m and run_multi.m illustrate how the function is called and equipped with corresponding data and parameters.
